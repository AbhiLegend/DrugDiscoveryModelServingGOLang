What is the Python code doing
ob.py

This code snippet is a Flask web application designed to predict properties of molecules and generate their images based on their SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representations. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code is doing:

Importing Libraries: Essential libraries are imported for the functionality of the application, including Flask for web app development, RDKit for cheminformatics, NumPy for numerical operations, OpenVINO for machine learning model inference, and standard libraries for handling byte streams and file operations.

Initializing Flask App: A Flask application instance is created.

Loading OpenVINO Model: The application loads a pre-trained OpenVINO model from the specified path ('lipophilicity_openvino.xml'). This model is presumably used for predicting properties of molecules.

Function smiles_to_fp: This function converts a SMILES string to a fingerprint representation of the molecule. This fingerprint is a fixed-size vector used as input for machine learning models.

Function mol_to_image: This function generates an image of the molecule from its SMILES string. It first creates a temporary image file of the molecule, reads this file into a BytesIO object (a way of handling binary data in memory), and then deletes the temporary file.

Flask Route /predict:

The predict function is a Flask route that handles POST requests.
It expects JSON data with a SMILES string representing a molecule.
The SMILES string is converted to a molecular object and a fingerprint.
The fingerprint is fed into the OpenVINO model for prediction.
An image of the molecule is generated.
If successful, the image is sent back as a response; otherwise, a JSON response with the prediction and an error message is returned.
Running the App: The Flask application is configured to run in debug mode on port 5000.

In summary, this web application serves as an interface to accept a molecule's SMILES representation, perform a property prediction using a machine learning model, and return both the prediction and an image representation of the molecule.

## What is the use of the go code
This Go code defines a simple command-line application that interacts with a Flask API (presumably the one you described earlier) to predict properties of molecules and retrieve their images based on their SMILES strings. Here is a detailed explanation of what each part of the code does:

Importing Packages: Standard Go packages are imported for handling HTTP requests, JSON encoding, input/output operations, and basic functionalities.

Defining PredictionRequest Structure:

A structure PredictionRequest is defined with a single field Smiles, which is annotated with a JSON struct tag. This struct represents the request payload for the API.
Function makePredictionRequest:

This function takes the API URL and a SMILES string as input.
It creates a PredictionRequest object with the given SMILES string and marshals it into JSON format.
It then sends an HTTP POST request to the specified API URL with the JSON data.
If the API call is successful, the response is assumed to be an image file. The function saves this image to the local file system as molecule_image.png.
The function includes error handling for JSON marshalling, HTTP request failures, file creation, and file writing.
Main Function:

The Flask API URL (http://localhost:5000/predict) is defined.
The program prompts the user to enter a SMILES string.
The entered SMILES string is read from the standard input.
The makePredictionRequest function is called with the API URL and the entered SMILES string to make the prediction request and save the returned image.
Overall, this Go application serves as a client that sends a SMILES string to a Flask API, which performs lipophilicity prediction and molecule image generation. The Go application then saves the returned image locally. This allows users to interact with the Flask API through a simple command-line interface.
